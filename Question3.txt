Functionality:
1. Name, middle name and last name takes alphanumeric values but prompts about the same that only alphabets and dot can be given.
2.Phone number and mobile number both only take numeric values, which is correct also if invalid mobile number given, it is prompting the same. Works fine.
3. Adhar card no. ake numeric values and if invalid number given, it is prompting the same. Works fine.
4. Nearby Reference Consumer No - takes numric values and prompts if invalid value given. Works fine.
5. If pincode given only then the Select area and selct road name values are population accordingly which is great.
6. If we click on reset all button then some of the nom mandatory fields like adhar card number,test report no do not get rest, which is wrong everything should get reset.
7. Submit button is not ebabled until and unless we fill all the mandatory fields, which is right.



Usability:
1.The website can be made more easy to understand, as some of the fields in connection details might not be familiar to the customer and he/she may end up given wrong information.
2.For some fields it takes alphanumeric values and after pressing enter it gives a prompt that only alphabets should be used, which can be improvised but allowing only alphabets in the box.


UI aesthetics:
1. Very less use of white spaces, which makes it look messier.
2. Muted colors are used, which is good.
3. The webpage looks very complicated and can be made more presentable so that the user has a good experience using it.
4. Alignment looks uneven.
